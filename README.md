# Counter App

This is a simple counter app built with React and Vite.

**Features:**

* Increment and decrement a counter
* Ensure that the count cannot go below zero
* Visually appealing CSS styling

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Test Task: Build a Counter Application

### Description

You are required to create a React application that allows users to increment and decrement a counter.

Requirements:

1. Create a new React application using Create React App or your preferred setup.
2. Implement a user interface with the following components:
3. Display the current count.
4. Buttons for incrementing and decrementing the count.
5. Use React state to manage the counter value.
6. Implement functions to increment and decrement the count when the corresponding buttons are clicked.
7. Ensure that the count cannot go below zero (minimum value is 0).
8. Use CSS for styling to make the app visually appealing.
9. Use version control (e.g., Git) to track your changes and share your code via a public repository on GitHub or a similar platform.
Bonus (Optional):

10. Add a reset button to set the counter back to zero.
11. Implement unit tests for your components.
12. Add animations or transitions for a smoother user experience.
